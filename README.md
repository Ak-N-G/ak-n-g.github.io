# Ak-N-G — Portfolio

This repository hosts a static portfolio website for Akshar Nath Gorain (GitHub: `workforakng`).

What I changed:
- Homepage now includes a "Projects" section which loads public repositories from `https://api.github.com/users/workforakng/repos` and displays them as cards.
- Updated `about.html` with a concise bio and contact information.

How to run locally:

1. Open a terminal in the repository root:

```powershell
cd c:\Games\ak-n-g.github.io
python -m http.server 8000
```

2. Open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.
